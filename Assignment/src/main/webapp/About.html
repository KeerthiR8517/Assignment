<h2>NoBroker - Real Estate Industry Details</h2>
<p>Indian real estate market, which was valued at Rs. 12,000 crore (US$ 1.63 billion) in 2019 is expected to have steady growth and will be reaching Rs 65,000 crores ($8.83 bn) by the year 2040, as per IBEF estimates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the market size of the real estate sector in India, which was estimated to be around US$ 120 billion in 2017, will be expected to grow to US$ 1 trillion by 2030 and will contribute nearly 13% to the countryâ€™s GDP by 2025.

Besides, Indian firms are also expected to raise more than $48 billion with the help of infrastructure and real estate investment trusts in 2022 when compared to raised funds, which are worth $29 billion to date, according to ICRA.</p> 

<p>The growth of the real estate sector across residential and commercial spaces will be chiefly driven by the growing urbanization of the tier-II and tier-III regions, an increase in the average household income levels, and the rise of nuclear families. 
	Another factor driving this growth will be the increasing shift towards homeownership in the wake of the pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak made people realize the importance of owning a home and the financial security that comes with a valuable physical asset like a house.
	 This changing consumer sentiment will contribute hugely towards changing the market trends.</p>
